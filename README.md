The File/Directory comparison program enables you to create a “ snapshot ” of your system based
on a directory “ base ” you provide. It will also perform a comparison of two snapshots to show you
the differences. This includes items missing from snapshot 1 but in snapshot 2, and items missing
in snapshot 2 but present in snapshot 1.
